    "opinion": "Barrick noted that nearly 90% of long-term care residents have some form of cognitive impairment, including over two-thirds who live with dementia. These residents have unique care needs—needs which are not being met in far too many homes.",
    "lastInfo": "Instead, under-resourced homes have resorted to the dehumanising use of restraints and potentially inappropriate use of medication: residents living with dementia are three times as likely to be subjected to the daily use of physical restraints, and twice as likely to be prescribed antipsychotics without a diagnosis of psychosis.  These issues long predate the current pandemic. “Dementia and long-term care are inseparable”, says Barrick.  “The voices of residents, care partners, and families impacted by dementia must be given a prominent voice by the commission.” SOURCE",
